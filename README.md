# Computational methods for transport phenomena

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises assigned during the Computational methods for transport phenomena held by prof. Dapor at unitn. I took this class during the second semester of my 2021-2022 accademic year.

#### Exercise 01:
_Use Gnuplot to calculate the first Legendre polynomials and graphically represent them._

#### Exercise 02:
_Use Gnuplot to calculate the first Legendre polynomials **recursively** and graphically represent them._

#### Exercise 03-09:
These are Some theoretical exercises useful to understand Exercise 10.

#### Exercise 10:
_Write a C program to numerically calculate the Legendre polynomials and the associated Legendre functions for any value of l._  
An analysis between the function written and the GSL function was carried out too.

#### Exercise 10:
_Write a C program to numerically calculate the Legendre polynomials and the associated Legendre functions for any value of l._  
An analysis between the different methods and the GSL functions was carried out.

#### Exercise 11:
_Write a C program to numerically calculate the spherical Bessel Functions._  
An analysis between the different methods and the GSL functions was carried out.

#### Exercise 12:
_Write a C program to numerically calculate the screened Rutherford cross-section._
