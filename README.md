# Computational methods for transport phenomena

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises assigned during the Computational methods for transport phenomena held by prof. Dapor at unitn.

#### Exercise 01:
Use Gnuplot to calculate the first Legendre polynomials and graphically represent them.

#### Exercise 02:
Use Gnuplot to calculate the first Legendre polynomials **recursively** and graphically represent them.

#### Exercise 03-09:
These are Some theoretical exercises useful to understand Exercise 10.

#### Exercise 10:
Write a C program to numerically calculate the Legendre polynomials and the associated Legendre functions for any value of l.
